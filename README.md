# SX Ambient Occlusion
![SX Ambient Occlusion](/sxao-intro.png)
A simple tool for vertex ambient occlusion in Blender.

### Features
- Bakes vertex normal -based ambient occlusion into vertex colors (using custom attributes)
- Allows blending between self-occlusion only and full scene occlusion
- Supports an optional groundplane
- Also supports mesh thickness (useful for subsurface and transmission effects)

SXAO is a standalone separate release from [SX Tools 2 for Blender](https://github.com/FrandSX/sxtools2-blender).
